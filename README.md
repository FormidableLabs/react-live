**React Live** brings you the ability to render React components with editable source code and live preview.
It supports server-side rendering and comes in a tiny bundle.

The library is structured modularly and lets you style and compose its components freely.

## Usage

Install it with `npm install react-live` or `yarn add react-live` and try out this piece of JSX:

```jsx
import {
  LiveProvider,
  LiveEditor,
  LiveError,
  LivePreview
} from 'react-live'

<LiveProvider code="<strong>Hello World!</strong>">
  <LiveEditor />
  <LiveError />
  <LivePreview />
</LiveProvider>
```

## FAQ

### How does it work?

It takes your code and transpiles it with [Bublé](https://github.com/bublejs/buble), while the code is displayed using [`react-simple-code-editor`](https://github.com/satya164/react-simple-code-editor) and the code is highlighted using [`prism-react-renderer`](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/prism-react-renderer).

The transpiled code is then rendered in the preview component (`LivePreview`), which does a fake mount if the code
is a React component.

### What code can I use?

The code can be one of the following things:

- React elements, e.g. `<strong>Hello World!</strong>`
- React pure functional components, e.g. `() => <strong>Hello World!</strong>`
- React component classes

If you enable the `noInline` prop on your `LiveProvider`, you’ll be able to write imperative code,
and render one of the above things by calling `render`.

### How does the scope work?

The `scope` prop on the `LiveProvider` accepts additional globals. By default it injects `React` only, which
means that the user can use it in their code like this:

```jsx
//                    ↓↓↓↓↓
class Example extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <strong>Hello World!</strong>
  }
}
```

But you can of course pass more things to the scope. They will be available as variables in the code. Here's an example using [styled components](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components):

```jsx
import styled from 'styled-components';

const headerProps = { text: 'I\'m styled!' };

const scope = {styled, headerProps};

const code = `
  const Header = styled.div\`
    color: palevioletred;
    font-size: 18px;
  \`

  render(<Header>{headerProps.text}</Header>)
`

<LiveProvider code={code} scope={scope} noInline={true}>
  <LiveEditor />
  <LiveError />
  <LivePreview />
</LiveProvider>
```

Here's an example using a custom component `<MyButton />`. This component lives in a different directory. It gets passed into the scope wrapped in an Object. Note that since we are not using `render()` in the code snippet we let `noInline` stay equal to the default of `false`:

```jsx

import { MyButton } from './components/MyButton';

const scope = { MyButton };

const code = `
  <MyButton />
`

<LiveProvider code={code} scope={scope}>
  <LiveEditor />
  <LiveError />
  <LivePreview />
</LiveProvider>
```

### What bundle size can I expect?

Our reported bundle size badges don't give you the full picture of
the kind of sizes you will get in a production app. The minified
bundles we publish _exclude_ some dependencies that we depend
on.

<img src="http://img.badgesize.io/https://unpkg.com/react-live/dist/react-live.min.js?compression=gzip&label=gzip%20size">

In an actual app when you use `react-live` you will also be bundling
Buble for transpilation, which adds `~135kB` to your bundle. This also
includes their dependency on `regenerate-unicode-properties`, which
is rather large as well.

We maintain a fork of Buble which excludes the ESnext Regular Expression
transpilation with removes Buble's large dependency and weighs in at
a smaller size of `~51kB`, which you can find published at [`@philpl/buble`](http://npm.im/@philpl/buble).

You can alias this in Webpack or the build tool of your choice, which
will reduce the overall bundle size of `react-live` to about `83kB`.

## API

### &lt;LiveProvider /&gt;

This component provides the `context` for all the other ones. It also transpiles the user’s code!
It supports these props, while passing any others through to the `children`:

|Name|PropType|Description|
|---|---|---|
|code|PropTypes.string|The code that should be rendered, apart from the user’s edits
|scope|PropTypes.object|Accepts custom globals that the `code` can use
|noInline|PropTypes.bool|Doesn’t evaluate and mount the inline code (Default: `false`). Note: when using `noInline` whatever code you write must be a single expression (function, class component or some `jsx`) that can be returned immediately. If you'd like to render multiple components, use `noInline={true}`
|transformCode|PropTypes.func|Accepts and returns the code to be transpiled, affording an opportunity to first transform it
|language|PropTypes.string|What language you're writing for correct syntax highlighting. (Default: `jsx`)
|disabled|PropTypes.bool|Disable editing on the `<LiveEditor />` (Default: `false`)
|theme|PropTypes.object|A `prism-react-renderer` theme object. See more [here](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/prism-react-renderer#theming)


All subsequent components must be rendered inside a provider, since they communicate
using one.

The `noInline` option kicks the Provider into a different mode, where you can write imperative-style
code and nothing gets evaluated and mounted automatically. Your example will need to call `render`
with valid JSX elements.

### &lt;LiveEditor /&gt;

This component renders the editor that displays the code. It is a wrapper around [`react-simple-code-editor`](https://github.com/satya164/react-simple-code-editor) and the code highlighted using [`prism-react-renderer`](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/prism-react-renderer).

|Name|PropType|Description|
|---|---|---|
|style|PropTypes.object|Allows overriding default styles on the `LiveEditor` component.


### &lt;LiveError /&gt;

This component renders any error that occur while executing the code, or transpiling it.
It passes through any props to a `pre`.

> Note: Right now when the component unmounts, when there’s no error to be shown.

### &lt;LivePreview /&gt;

This component renders the actual component that the code generates inside an error boundary.

|Name|PropType|Description|
|---|---|---|
|Component|PropTypes.node|Element that wraps the generated code. (Default: `div`)


### withLive

The `withLive` method creates a higher-order component, that injects the live-editing props provided
by `LiveProvider` into a component.

Using this HOC allows you to add new components to react-live, or replace the default ones, with a new
desired behavior.

The component wrapped with `withLive`  gets injected the following props:

|Name|PropType|Description|
|---|---|---|
|code|PropTypes.string|Reflects the code that is passed in as the `code` prop
|error|PropTypes.string|An error that the code has thrown when it was previewed
|onError|PropTypes.func|A callback that, when called, changes the error to what's passed as the first argument
|onChange|PropTypes.func|A callback that accepts new code and transpiles it
|element|React.Element|The result of the transpiled code that is previewed


> Note: The code prop doesn't reflect the up-to-date code, but the `code` prop, that is passed to the `LiveProvider`.


## FAQ
> **I want to use experimental feature x but Bublé doesn't support it! Can I use babel instead?**

`react-live` doesn't currently support configuring the transpiler and it ships with Bublé.  The current workaround for using some experimental features `bublé` doesn't support  would be to use the `transformCode` prop on `LiveProvider` to transform your code with `babel` alongside `bublé`.

Here is a  minimal example on how you could use `babel` to support class-properties in `react-live`:

## Comparison to [component-playground](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/component-playground)

There are multiple options when it comes to live, editable React component environments. Formidable actually has **two** first class projects to help you out: [`component-playground`](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/component-playground) and [`react-live`](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/react-live). Let's briefly look at the libraries, use cases, and factors that might help in deciding which is right for you.

Here's a high-level decision tree:

- If you want **fast and easy** setup and integration, then `component-playground` may be the ticket!
- If you want **a smaller bundle**, **SSR**, and **more flexibility**, then `react-live` is for you!

Here are the various factors at play:

- **Build**: `component-playground` uses `babel-standalone`, `react-live` uses `bublé`. (_Note_: `react-live` might make transpiler customizable in the future).
- **Bundle size**: `component-playground` has a larger bundle, but uses a more familiar editor setup. `react-live` is smaller, but more customized editor around `prism`.
- **Ease vs. flexibility**: `react-live` is more modular/customizable, while `component-playground` is easier/faster to set up.
- **SSR**: `component-playground` is not server-side renderable, `react-live` is.
- **Extra features**: `component-playground` supports raw evaluation and pretty-printed output out-of-the-box, while `react-live` does not.
- **Error handling**: `component-playground` might have more predictable error handling than `react-live` in some cases (due to `react-dom`, although this might change with React 16).

## Maintenance Status

**Active:** Formidable is actively working on this project, and we expect to continue for work for the foreseeable future. Bug reports, feature requests and pull requests are welcome.
